Rewrite the following content to sound more natural and human-like, while preserving the core message and meaning.

IMPORTANT: Provide only the rewritten text. No explanations, no meta-commentary, no thinking process.

Guidelines:
- Maintain similar length and structure to the original
- Use varied sentence lengths naturally
- Write as if explaining to an informed colleague, not lecturing
- Replace overly formal or academic language with clearer alternatives
- Keep technical terms when necessary, but explain them naturally
- Avoid unnecessary questions or rhetorical devices
- Use straightforward transitions between ideas
- Present information directly without excessive casual interjections

Avoid:
- Overly formal academic language ("Furthermore", "In conclusion", "Moreover")
- Perfectly structured, symmetrical paragraphs
- Robotic or repetitive sentence patterns
- Excessive use of questions or exclamations
- Talking down to the reader or over-explaining basic concepts
- Adding filler words just to sound casual ("like", "you know", "I mean")

Goal: Make the text feel like it was written by a knowledgeable person communicating clearly, not by an AI or an academic paper. The result should be professional but accessible, informative but not stiff.
